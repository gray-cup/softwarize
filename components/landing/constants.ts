It's a browser-based screenshot beautifier — drop a capture, add device frames (Safari, Chrome, Arc, iPhone, MacBook), pick a backdrop (or sample one from the screenshot), add annotations, and export PNG/JPEG/WebP or share a public link.

Pitch it to indie devs and designers who want their app screenshots to look intentional without firing up Figma.`
